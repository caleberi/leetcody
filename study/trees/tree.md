## Tree
- Tree can be defined `a directed acyclic children ` which has `N - nodes` and `N - 1 edges`.
- `Binary Tree`is one of the most used of typical tree structure . It is a tree data structure which each node has `at most 2 children` which are the ` left child && right child `

- Inorder Traversal  - `LNR`
- Preorder Traversal - `NLR`
- Postorder Traversal  - `LRN`

`Breadth-First Search` is an algorithm to traverse or search in data structures like a tree or a graph. The algorithm starts with a root node and visit the node itself first. Then traverse its neighbors, traverse its second level neighbors, traverse its third level neighbors, so on and so forth.
